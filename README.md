# J2F
A simple chrome extension designed to fill in forms using JSON.

The extension was created to workaround a problem with pages that don't allow an api integration to export some data.

The idea is very simple... After check for all inputs id, just make your JSON with key (input id) and value (your information), 
then open the extension, paste your JSON and click on "Load your JSON" button.

The extension will be soon available on Chrome web store. :)
