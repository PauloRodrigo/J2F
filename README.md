# J2F – JSON to Form
A lightweight Chrome extension that simplifies form filling using JSON.

This extension was developed as a workaround for web pages that don’t support API integration for data import. It enables you to quickly populate form fields by mapping input IDs to values via a JSON object.

How it works
  -  Inspect the form and identify the id of each input field you want to fill.

  -  Create a JSON object where each key is an input id and each value is the corresponding data you want to insert.

  -  Open the extension, paste your JSON, and click the "Load your JSON" button.

That’s it — the extension will automatically populate the form fields with your data.
